## COSCUP 2011 is calling for sponsorships!

COSCUP is the largest annual <abbr title="Free/Libre/Open Source Software">FLOSS</abbr> conference organized by local communities in Taiwan. The conference has sessions for newbie users, enthusiastic promoters, coders or anyone who is interested in the cutting-edge <abbr title="Free/Libre/Open Source Software">FLOSS</abbr> technologies. The goal is to create a friendly and informative environment for people in different communities to make friends, learn new technologies and inspire each other in the conference.

### Call for Proposals will be started from May 7th

The main theme of COSCUP 2011 is "Gadgets beyond Smartphones". Phones
based on Google's open source Android operating system are leading in the
U.S., U.K., France, Germany and Japan. Besides smart phones, the
introduction of the tablet-only Android 3.0 (Honeycomb) has spurred many
analysts to predict that the wave of tablets this year will be dominated by
Android-based devices. The adoption of open source software doesn't stop
there. Televisions, set-top boxes, in-car information systems, medical
hand-held devices are all being built with open source software -- Google
TV, Next TV's popular set-top box in Taiwan are just 2 such examples. It is
clear that the open source paradigm has established a strong foothold in the
device space.
