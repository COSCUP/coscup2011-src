## COSCUP 2011

COSCUP is the largest annual <abbr title="Free/Libre/Open Source Software">FLOSS</abbr> conference organized by local communities in Taiwan. The conference has sessions for new users, enthusiastic promoters, coders or anyone who is interested in cutting-edge <abbr title="Free/Libre/Open Source Software">FLOSS</abbr> technologies. The goal is to create a friendly and informative environment for people from different communities to make friends, learn new technologies and inspire each other.

## Program will be announced on July 11th

The main theme of COSCUP 2011 is “Gadgets beyond Smartphones”. Phones
based on Google's open source Android operating system are leading the market in the
U.S., U.K., France, Germany and Japan. Besides smartphones, the
introduction of the tablet-only Android 3.0 (Honeycomb) has spurred many
analysts to predict that the wave of tablets this year will be dominated by
Android-based devices. The adoption of open source software doesn't stop
there. Televisions, set-top boxes, in-car information systems, medical
hand-held devices are all being built with open source software — Google
TV and Next TV's popular set-top box in Taiwan are just 2 such examples. It is
clear that the open source paradigm has established a strong foothold in the
device space.
