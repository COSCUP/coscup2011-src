A lot of attention has been on the smart phone market since the introduction of iPhone in 2007. In this highly competitive market sector, phones based on Google's open source Android operating system are leading in the U.S., U.K., France, Germany and Japan as of March 2011 according to an article by the Guardian.
Tablets are the new kids on the block with an explosion of tablet devices predicted in 2011 as Engadget states, "It's been raining tablets here in CES 2011." The introduction of the tablet-only Android 3.0 (Honeycomb) has spurred many analysts to predict that the wave of tablets this year will be dominated by Android-based devices.
The adoption of open source software doesn't stop there. Televisions, set-top boxes, in-car information systems, medical hand-held devices are all being built with open source software such as Google TV and Next TV's popular set-top box in Taiwan. It is clear that the open source paradigm has established a strong foothold in the device space.
With limited computing power and storage space on devices, an internet connection and server/cloud side support are essential. Powered by cloud computing, internet access has taken both mobile and non-mobile devices to a new level by bringing intelligence and content to devices.
