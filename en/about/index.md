## About COSCUP

Open source software is supported by 3 groups: coders, users and promoters. This conference is aimed at all three groups. No matter whether you are a new user, a passionate promoter, mature developer or anywhere in between, you are welcome at COSCUP, the Conference for Open Source Coders, Users and Promoters!

COSCUP is organized by major open source communities in Taiwan. The major goal is to create a friendly and informative environment for people from different communities to make friends, learn new technologies and inspire each other.

COSCUP 2011 is the 7th annual conference. During this time COSCUP has become the biggest annual open source community party in Taiwan. We want to bring communities together and hopefully be the catalyst for new and exciting projects.
